# Zomato-Dashboard

So, I have created this report to get deep dive analysis on sales of India's most famous food ordering application ZOMATO

I have took the data from kaggle and then load it into PowerBi

With the use of DAX functions various parameters, I have created the dashboard.

I also make use of buttons and bookmark for ease of navigation between multiple report pages

Mainly, there are 3 report pages 1) Overview of sales 2) User performance and 3) City performance
